This is a simple script I wrote in order to generate labels for the books I
catalogued using Tellico (tellico-project.org).

As it's been written to solve my personal problem, it is not very universal 
and some things, like the input file name, are still hardcoded. Furthermore,
I used a non standard Tellico book collections with some custom fields added
to it, namely to track the location of the books in my house (room and shelf).

I'm however publishing these few lines of code as it should be pretty easy for
anyone facing a similar task to tweak the code to her/his needs.

The labels contain a QRcode, the title, author and location, and the output is
in PDF format.

The input of the script is the Tellico collection exported as XML.
For ease of testing, I am including my current catalogue in libri.xml.

Enjoy!
